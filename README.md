- About me: <br/>
  Student of the computer science course at the Federal University of Alagoas, I am always in constant evolution to expand my knowledge and skills. I worked as a mobile developer, using flutter, and generating reports with SQL Server.

  Facing new challenges and working with problem solving is part of the technology professional. I'm ready to apply my knowledge to solve problems and thus be able to impact people's lives using technology. Programming languages are mere tools for solving problems efficiently. I am very anxious to be able to contribute positively in the area of technology.
